# Lyrics
This includes the lyrics of a Song called "People do not need freedom“ by Li Zhi and I have included the English translated lyrics in it

一个兄弟来看我，带着银子和故事，他微笑着对我说，人民不需要自由
人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代，人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代

有人沉默著观望，有人怀疑着生活，听见他们在歌唱，人民不需要自由
人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代，人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代

兄弟喝多了在哭，爱人迷失了太久，这时我总会想起，人民不需要自由
人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代，人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代

父亲留下了一切，除了袋子和被子，他一直想告诉我，人民不需要自由
人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代，人民不需要自由，这是最好的年代

A brother came to see me, he brings money and a story, he smiled and said to me, people do not need freedom.

People do not need freedom, this is the best era, people do not need freedom, this is the best era.

Some people are silent while watching, some people doubt about life, I hear that they are singing, people do not need freedom.

People do not need freedom, this is the best era, people do not need freedom, this is the best era.

My brother is drunk and he is crying, and my lover has been lost for too long. This moment always remind me that, people do not need freedom.

People do not need freedom, this is the best era, people do not need freedom, this is the best era.

My father left me everything, except the bag and the quilt, he always tried to tell me, people do not need freedom.

People do not need freedom, this is the best era, people do not need freedom, this is the best era.
